# Fall Detection

This repository contains an implementation for a fall detection system using machine learning and sensor data. The goal of this project is to accurately detect falls in real-time, which can be valuable for elderly care, health monitoring, and emergency response systems.

## Overview

Fall detection is a crucial aspect of health monitoring for elderly people and those with medical conditions. This project leverages data from sensors (such as accelerometers and gyroscopes) and machine learning algorithms to identify falls with high accuracy.

## Features

- Preprocessing and cleaning of sensor data
- Feature extraction for time-series signals
- Machine learning model training (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Evaluation and accuracy metrics
- Real-time fall detection pipeline (optional, for deployment)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purnatejaTaskani/fall-detection.git
   cd fall-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies (assuming Python and pip are used):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your sensor data in the required format (see [Dataset](#dataset) section).
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate or use the model for real-time detection:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --input your_test_data.csv
   ```

## Dataset

The project expects input data from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, ideally with labels indicating falls and non-fall activities. You can use public datasets (such as MobiAct or SisFall) or collect your own.

## Model

The repository supports several machine learning models for classification. Details about model architecture, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning can be found in the respective code files and documentation.

## Results

After training, the model's performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) will be printed and optionally saved to a results folder.
